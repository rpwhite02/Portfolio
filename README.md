# [Project 1: Data Visualizations and Predictions](https://github.com/rpwhite02/Portfolio/tree/main/Project%201)
* Use python libraries pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
* Created lineplots and barplots using matplotlib and seaborn, as well as a decision tree regression model using scikit-learn.
* Based on a dataset from the National Center for Education Statistics called "Percentage of persons 25 to 29 years old with
selected levels of educational attainment, by race/ethnicity and sex: Selected years, 1920 through 2018."
* Answered questions regarding the types of degrees that percentages of people of different races and genders acquire and predicted
degree types using a decision tree regression model.

# [Project 2: Python Search Engine](https://github.com/rpwhite02/Portfolio/tree/main/Project%202)
* Assignment from my Data Programming class which utilized classes and objects in Python.
* Code to setup a server to host the search engine was given to the class, as well as HTML and CSS
code that set up the presentation and functionality of the search engine website.
* The document file contains the document class which represents all the data and words in a
single web page (document) and computes the term frequency for a given term in a document.
* The search engine file contains the search engine class which represents a directory of document
objects and computes the TFIDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) score for a given
search query in each document object. In other words, this class computes how important a word
in a search query is to what the user is searching for.
* The included python code for this project is just to look through web pages and scan them for all words, as
well as calculate the importance of a word in a search query and present web pages (documents) that
correlate with the search query. Code to set up the server and website isn't included.
